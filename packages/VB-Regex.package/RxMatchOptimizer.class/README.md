A match start optimizer, handy for searching a string. Takes a regex syntax tree and sets itself up so that prefix characters or matcher states that cannot start a match are later recognized with #canStartMatch:in: method.
Used by RxMatcher, but can be used by other matchers (if implemented) as well.
