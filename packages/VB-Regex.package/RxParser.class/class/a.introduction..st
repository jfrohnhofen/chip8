A regular expression is a template specifying a class of strings. A
regular expression matcher is an tool that determines whether a string
belongs to a class specified by a regular expression.  This is a
common task of a user input validation code, and the use of regular
expressions can GREATLY simplify and speed up development of such
code.  As an example, here is how to verify that a string is a valid
hexadecimal number in Smalltalk notation, using this matcher package:
	aString matchesRegex: '16r[[:xdigit:]]+'
(Coding the same ``the hard way'' is an exercise to a curious reader).
This matcher is offered to the Smalltalk community in hope it will be
useful. It is free in terms of money, and to a large extent--in terms
of rights of use. Refer to `Boring Stuff' section for legalese.
The 'What's new in this release' section describes the functionality
introduced in 1.1 release.
The `Syntax' section explains the recognized syntax of regular
expressions.
The `Usage' section explains matcher capabilities that go beyond what
String>>matchesRegex: method offers.
The `Implementation notes' sections says a few words about what is
under the hood.
